## My process

### What I learned

I initially started off using flex-box for the card component but eventually switched to grid to handle the image. I used a span to create an overlay over the image and used `
 mix-blend-mode: multiple` to allow the photo to come through.

I will now use grid for most of my intial layout process;

### Continued development

Improve unecessary css.
